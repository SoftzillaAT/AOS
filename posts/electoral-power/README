All data was collected in data.xlsx, of which data.csv is a dump sans forumlae of course.

The directory ecpower contains some code for generating plots of the data. There is
an R script for generating jpegs.

The directory elections is the raw election data from http://psephos.adam-carr.net
That directory has a README of its own. We used this to generate columns in the
spreadsheet telling which party won each state in presidential elections back to
1980.

The directory shapefiles has map data for the US and a dbf file with the per
capita voting power in it. There is some Python code for generating the dbf file.

I have a little utility program shp2svg, which was used to generate an svg file 
with the voting power data mapped onto it from the shapefile.

The command line used was:

shp2svg tl_2010_us_state10.shp -d 1 -o pow.svg -x 'translate(820,380),scale(6,-6)' -i 0 -lx 450 -ly 50 -lh 13 -lw 35 -lts 1 -ltx 5 -lty -3 -t Electoral Voting Power Per Capita -tx 55 -ty 25 -s map.css
